<h1>Illumination</h1>

<p>The selection of an illumination is a way to set the whitepoint.</p>

<p>Many applications in color research and industry are based on standard illuminants. Several of them are built in to Color Machine.</p>

<p>When selecting an illumination, the temperature field shows the correlated color temperature in Kelvin. When one of the two illuminations <q>Blackbody</q> or <q>D Illuminant</q> is selected, the temperature can be adjusted manually.</p>

<p>When <q>Custom Whitepoint</q> is selected, the whitepoint can be chosen arbitrarily. When the normalization flag is checked, the whitepoint will be scaled such that the Y value equals 1. If the flag is not checked, the Y value can be chosen arbitrarily.</p>

<p>You can also set a custom whitepoint with a menu command. Simply choose the desired color in any colorspace and choose the menu command or the appropriate keyboard shortcut. Note that choosing a whitepoint with this menu command will automatically uncheck the normalization.</p>

<p>Additionally, when <q>Custom Whitepoint</q> is selected, the correlated temperature can be estimated using an appropriate selection. Note that such a computation can be time consuming and therefore the selection "don't estimate" is set as a default.</p>
