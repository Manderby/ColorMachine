<h1>Displaying properties</h1>

<p>The colors which are displayed in the color displays can be changed in different ways.</p>

<p>By choosing an adaptation, the colors are adapted such that the whitepoint always is displayed as the white of the screen. Note that with the option <q>No adaptation</q>, all XYZ, Yxy and Yuv values remain the same for any whitepoint but the gray slope changes. For any other option, the gray slope remains the same but the XYZ, Yxy and Yuv change.</p>

<p>Please note that currently, due to technical restrictions, the space used for the chromatic adaptation is sRGB no matter what the screen settings of the system are. Therefore, no absolute colorimetric color measurements can be performed at this moment.</p>

<p>By enabling a mask, the colorspace chosen in the popup menu will be used as the border of displayable colors. All colors outside of that border are darkened.</p>

<p>By enabling a grid, gridlines of the colorspace chosen in the popup menu will be drawn. The thickness of the gridlines can be changed as well. Note that colors outside the selected colorspace can only be drawn continuously when all LUT are disabled (Float).</p>
