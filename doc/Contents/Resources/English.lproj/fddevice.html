<h1>FD-7 device</h1>

<p>You can measure spectral data with an FD-7 measurement device. Color Machine will automatically detect when you connect an FD-7 measurement device. A sidebar will open where all measurements will be visible.</p>

<p>If the device is not detected, make sure that the cable is plugged in, the on/off switch is turned on and no other application is connected to the device.</p>

<p>To measure spectra, you need to calibrate the device. The status of the calibration is shown in the colored indicator (C), whereas green is calibrated, red is not. If you have red-green color blindness, you can use the device to measure the emitted light and compare the Lab values (pun intended). But seriously, if the device is calibrated, the C vanishes and an empty green circle remains.</p>

<p>Calibrating the device simply requires you to attach the device to the measurement mount and press the device down on the white plate. As soon as the device is calibrated, the indicator turns green and the device can be lifted again. You can now measure reflectance (remission, spot) by pressing the device down at your colors and irradiance (illumination) by pressing the measure button.</p>

<p>Note that currently, reflectance spectra are always measured with the UV part of D50.</p>

<p>The name FD-7 as well as the software driver is &copy; Konica Minolta.</p>
