<h1>3D View</h1>

<p>In the 3D view, colorspaces can be visualized. By dragging the mouse, the displayed colorspaces can be rotated. By using the scrollwheel, the colorspaces can be zoomed.</p>

<p>An arbitrary colorspace can be chosen as well as an arbitrary coordinate system in which the colorspace shall be displayed. The coordinate systems denoted with <q>Cartesian</q> show the hue as a cartesian axis rather than a rotation angle.</p>

<p>The background gray can be changed according to the needs as well as the number of points shown (Steps) and the perspective (Fovy) and the display of the spectral curve. The lowest setting of the Fovy denotes a parallel projection.</p>
